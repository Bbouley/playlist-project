##Purpose

- Provide a simple interface to allow users to create playlists and then populate those playlists with songs.


##Features

- user can add links to songs
- user can add a picture that will become the background of their playlist 'square'
- user can scroll through other playlists and when they click on it they can view all songs contained within that playlist
- user can filter playlists based on what mood the playlist has been given

##Technology

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- JQuery

##Implementation

- OOP

##Possible Difficulties

- Filtering playlists and allowing more than one filter at a time
- Taking user inputted photo links and using that to style the playlist box
- Updating DOM elements without interference with what's already present on the page

#Stretch Goals

- Include a rating system for songs and for playlists
- Use soundcloud API to bring in 'sounds' directly when a user adds a song
- Use local storage to allow users to customize their own version of the app
